    Anabelle is a rising senior in Computer Science at Stanford University. During the summer of 2022, she worked as a tech intern at Algorithm Watch in Berlin, Germany. During this internship, she worked on AW's new iteration of their <a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/dataskop/" style="font-family: 'Archivo Black', sans-serif;color: #AC73FC;" class="link">DataSkop</a> project (focusing on TikTok) and on other small projects. Specifically, she collaborated with designing and refining the data visualizations for DataSkop, and she implemented some of the visualizations. She is particularly interested in any work centered around queerness, race/ethnicity, gender, the environment, climate change, animal welfare, and any work that intersects those categories. Currently, she is working on refining the functionality of the ASTRSC tool. This primarily involves optimizing the code so it can effectively detect the most amount of relevant words and ignore the most amount of irrelevant words, testing the tool, and adding new features to the ASTRSC website.
